This is the implemention of SRCNN Using Matlab and Keras
Step 1
first unzip the 91.rar, run preprocess.py  to produce training data
Step 2
Run Train.py
save model for every 5 epochs
Step 3
Run ColortoLum.mat to get test data luminance component
Step 4
Run pridict to get Luminance channel predicted output
Step 5
Run Srcnn_demo to get PSNR and SSIM values
Step 6
Run Final color to get Color images
After 1000 epochs i got the same results as original SRCNN
